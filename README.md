### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Learned that jQuery is a subset of JavaScript that was created to make it easier to add exciting and unique elements to a webpage. jQuery eliminates a lot of the confusing and long codes that would normally have to be typed out in order to achieve the desired layout or animation. jQuery can also be utilized to manipulate HTML, CSS, and AJAX.
2. Learned the specific code necissary to animate the ingredients and instructions tabs in the application. Using "fade in" and "animate" codes we were able to slowly fade in the the lists an adjust their heights and speed of fade. Once accomplished we were able to change the color of the h3 elementes using the "background-color" code. 
3. Learned what ID selectors are and how to use them. Used the ID "h3" a lot, followed by a command in order to change or manipulate something in the HTML document. For instance, we used the "h3" selector when we wanted to control what would happen if the id was clicked and also when it was hovered over.
